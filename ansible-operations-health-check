1. Create Ansible VMs (i.e. acs,web,db) using Vagrant file from github Link.
2. Install ansible in acs VM - CentOS or Ubuntu
3. Set root password for acs,web & db as root.

Now, Add the host entry for all the VMs (i.e. db & web) in acs by creating a separate file "hosts" not /etc/hosts to allow ansible operations across all the VMs.

[root@acs ~]# mkdir ansible
              cd ansible
[root@acs ansible]# vi hosts ----> enter the IP addr of web & db
                    192.168.33.42
                    192.168.33.43
    
After entering hosts entry check for Ansible ping (ansible operation connectivity) using below command:
[root@acs ansible]# ansible all -i hosts -m ping -s -k -u root --> Enter password as root. If it says failed,then allow passwordless ssh authentication.
This ping is not standard N/W Ping command. This is Ansible ping and it checks if "ansible operations" can run across all the VMs.It doesn't check the N/W connectivity.It's ansible health check command.

Setting up passwordless ssh authentication
==========================================

[root@acs ansible]# ssh-copy-id root@192.168.33.42  --> to copy the public and private keys to remote system.
                    if it says "no identity" found then create ssh key-gen with below command
        
[root@acs ansible]# ssh-keygen -t rsa --> to create the Public and Private keys
                    it will ask to enter file, enter passphrase...just press enter

[root@acs ansible]# ssh-copy-id root@192.168.33.42 --> now run this 
                    root@192.168.33.42's password:
                    Enter the root password as root.It will copy the public and private keys to remote system.
                    It will show as permission denied (publickey,............).
                    
                    So, Modify the file in "vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config" in the remote system 192.168.33.42 as per below.
                        a. PermitRootLogin yes --> enable it i.e. remove #, under #Authentication: Section
                        b. PasswordAuthentication No --> search this line & change this line to yes, Remove "No".
                        c. service sshd restart
                    
                    Now, try ssh-copy-id
                    
[root@acs ansible]# ssh-copy-id root@192.168.33.42 
                    root@192.168.33.42's password:
                    Enter the root password as root.

                    [root@acs ansible]#
                    
Now, try to ssh to db and it will login without asking the password.
[root@acs ansible]# ssh root@192.168.33.42
[root@db ~]#
It means ansible can perform the operations across the db VM. Setup the same for web VM to allow ansible operation from acs.

Now, run the anisble ping command it will allow to do the ansible operartions across all the VMs.
[root@acs ansible]# ansible all -i hosts -m ping -s -k -u root ---> it will show as SUCCESS.
                    -i --> inventory file hosts
                    -m --> place where we define the command ping
                    -s --> sudo 
                    -k --> Forcefully Ask for password
                    -u --> for user
